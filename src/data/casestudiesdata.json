      "project_summary": "During the Open Geodata training for the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a group composed of participants from the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre (FCSC) and the Department of Digital Ajman (Ajman Digital) worked on a project about turning Ajman into a 15-minute city. Building on their shared interest in the use of data and advanced technologies to transform decision-making processes, the group decided to work on a tool that could help them explore this concept. This case study adapts and extends the work done by the aforementioned group and shows how high resolution population density maps together with open source Geographic Information System (GIS) can help in exploring and planning what it means to design a 15-minute city.",

      "project_summary": "In the Philippines, the University of the Philippines Resilience Institute (UPRI) combined Metaâ€™s High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) with recent census data (2020) of the province of Bataan in order to generate an updated settlement area and population density map layer of the province. Using this updated population layer, UPRI was able to calculate and present the flood-hazard exposed population in the different barangays of the province.",
